# Magnetic Resonance Detection System

This project involves using the AD9833 signal generator to produce sinusoidal signals at specific frequencies, which are then amplified and transmitted omnidirectionally within a 200-meter radius. When these signals interact with materials that resonate at the corresponding frequencies, changes in magnetic resonance are detected. The system analyzes these changes to determine the direction of the material. This technique enables precise detection and localization of materials based on their unique resonant frequencies, offering applications in fields such as material science, security screening, and medical diagnostics.
